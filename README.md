This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning, specifically Linear Regression. We'll utilize a dataset containing features like square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, age, and corresponding house prices. The process involves data preprocessing to handle missing values and normalize data, feature engineering to create relevant features, training a Linear Regression model, and evaluating its performance using metrics like MSE, RMSE, and R-squared. The goal is to develop an accurate model that can predict house prices for new, unseen data, providing valuable insights for real estate industry professionals.
